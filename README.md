# My-Project
For my project, I will analyze the Malawi data.
This study focuses on estimating the mean trajectory of CRP during the course of pregnancy and characterizing interaction effects on this association.

To analyze the data you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using R commands.
install.packages("sas7bdat")
